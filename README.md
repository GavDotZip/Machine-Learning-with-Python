# Machine-Learning-with-Python
Using Machine Learning within Python

My thesis for the final year of my Masters Degree with University of Galway will see me undergo a full year
of research. My research title is Traffic Simulation using Machine Learning.

For this research title I will be using Python, R and SUMO.

Within Python I will be designing a machine learning algorithm for my traffic simulation. With R, I will
process data which has been collected from my simulation within SUMO.
